## Palette Recommendations

- **Primary colors**: Pick your primary color, and it should—ideally—be one of the main colors that’s associated with your brand (your brand guidelines will likely decide this).

- **Avoid absolute white or black**: They can strain the eyes due to their extreme contrast, so go for a grayscale palette from neutral black and white tints instead.

- **Keep things consistent**: Use the same colors for similar interactive elements (like buttons) in your color scheme to help users spot interactive components easily.

- **Follow the 60-30-10 Rule**: This rule states that 60% of your space should be a dominant color, 30% a secondary color, and 10% an accent color to create a balanced and visually appealing design.

- **Photos can be used to create a color palette**: Use a photo that represents your brand and extract colors from it to create a color palette. This can help you create a cohesive look and feel for your design.
